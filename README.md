# AirlineServices
This is one of my major projects that I completed by the end of second year. In this my main focus was to develop a website for airline services with the motive of enhancing my back-end skills.

A major project, including booking of tickets of flights ,checking availability of flights (time, dates), 
book seats generating tickets and maintaining data in back-end with all information of passenger with his 
transaction id (generating by machine) ensuring uniqueness of id of every user.
